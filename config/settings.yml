# GLOBAL CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file controls the behavior of the entire Agents_Manager package.
# Adjust these parameters to tune performance, sensitivity, and functionality.

# --- Global Settings ---
language: "es"                  # ISO code for the language (currently optimized for Spanish)
models_path: "config/models.yml" # Path to the model definition file

# --- Audio Listener (Microphone Input) ---
audio_listener:
  device_id: null               # Force a specific device ID (null = auto-detect)
  channels: 1                   # Audio channels: 1 = Mono, 2 = Stereo
  sample_rate: 16000            # Sampling rate in Hz (16000 is standard for speech)
  frames_per_buffer: 1000       # Buffer size for audio stream

# --- Wake Word Detection (Hotword) ---
wake_word:
  activation_phrase: "ok robot" # Primary activation phrase
  variants:                     # Acceptable variations of the phrase
    - "ok robot"
    - "okay robot"
    - "hey robot"
  vad_aggressiveness: 3         # (0 -> 3) 0 = least, 3 = most strict filtering
  required_hits: 10             # Consecutive partial matches required to trigger activation

# --- Speech-to-Text (STT - Whisper) ---
stt:
  device_selector: "cpu"        # Inference device: "cpu" or "cuda"
  sample_rate: 16000            # DO NOT CHANGE - Required sample rate for Whisper
  listen_seconds: 5.0           # Max recording duration after wake word detection
  min_silence_ms_to_drain: 100  # Silence duration (ms) required to stop recording early
  self_vocabulary: "DatIA Demographics" # Custom vocabulary hints for the model

  # Tuning Thresholds:
  no_speech_threshold: 0.5              # (0.0 -> 1.0) Higher = stricter
  hallucination_silence_threshold: 0.3  # (0.1 -> 0.9) Discard text if model suspects silence

# --- fuzzy_search & Information Retrieval ---
fuzzy_search:
  fuzzy_logic_accuracy_general: 0.70    # Similarity threshold (0.0 -> 1.0) to match fuzzy_search entries
  path_general: "config/data/general_rag.json" # Path to the knowledge base
  use_rapidfuzz: true                  # False: Only if rapidfuzz is not available

# --- Text-to-Speech (TTS) ---
tts:
  sample_rate: 24000            # Output sample rate
  device_selector: "cpu"        # Inference device: "cpu" or "cuda"
  volume: 2.0                   # Output volume multiplier
  speed: 1.0                    # Speech speed: 1.0 = Normal, 2.0 = Slow
